# CPPGM Programming Assignment 4: Complete preprocessing (`preproc`)

Adapted and combined from the original CPPGM preprocessing assignments.
See [NOTICE](../NOTICE) for attribution.

Build a preprocessor using the tokenizer, post-token converter, and
preprocessing-expression evaluator from PA1–PA3. It performs translation
phases 1 through 6 and the tokenization part of phase 7 under the course
rules below. Its reusable token pipeline becomes the parser's input.

Implement one program, `preproc`. Macro replacement and directive processing
are groups within this assignment, with the same file interface throughout.

## Input and output

```sh
preproc -o <outfile> <source1> [<source2> ...]
```

Read each UTF-8 source relative to the working directory. At least one source
is required. Reset macro definitions, conditional state, and pragma-once
state between primary sources. Included files share the state of their
including translation unit.

Create or replace the output file with:

```text
preproc <number-of-primary-sources>
sof <source1>
<PA2 posttoken records>
eof
sof <source2>
<PA2 posttoken records>
eof
```

The `sof` spelling is the command-line source path. There is one `eof` for
each primary source; included files do not introduce `sof` or `eof` records.
PA2 defines token spelling, literal data, and string-literal concatenation.
This text is a test observation. Share structured tokens with later stages;
you do not need to turn the dump into an internal transport format.

For example, if `first.cpp` contains `#define F(x) x x` followed by `F(3)`,
and `second.cpp` contains `F`, then:

```sh
preproc -o /tmp/tokens first.cpp second.cpp
```

produces:

```text
preproc 2
sof first.cpp
literal 3 int 03000000
literal 3 int 03000000
eof
sof second.cpp
identifier F
eof
```

Return `EXIT_SUCCESS` on success. Return `EXIT_FAILURE` on a preprocessing
error, an active `#error`, an erroneous controlling expression, a missing
include, or an invalid phase-7 token. Output-file contents after failure
are unspecified. Standard output and standard error are ignored. As in
PA1, unsupported inputs outside the documented course contract do not create
additional requirements. Arguments beginning with `-` other than the initial
`-o` are outside this interface.

## Implementation order

1. Implement [macro replacement](macros.md): definitions, arguments,
   stringizing, token pasting, rescanning, and recursion suppression.
2. Implement conditional inclusion using the PA3 evaluator, including nested
   inactive groups and macro-expanded controlling expressions.
3. Add [file inclusion and directives](directives.md): include search, source
   locations, line control, predefined macros, pragmas, and `_Pragma`.
4. Check integration: macro definitions from headers, locations through
   expansions, pragma-once file identity, and translation-unit state reset.

The macro group needs only ordinary source files containing macro directives
and text. You can run it before supporting includes or conditionals. Preserve
the course-defined recursion rules in `macros.md`; a host preprocessor is not
an exact oracle for those rules. The directives handout specifies the default
include search and predefined values. Hosted-system-header compatibility is
later work.

## Starter and tests

Continue in the shared `dev/` tree. The student export installs
`dev/preproc.cpp` from the preprocessor scaffold, including a host file-identity
helper for `#pragma once`. Reuse your earlier token and expression machinery.
There is no additional starter-kit checkout.

Run these commands from this assignment directory:

```sh
make check TEST='tests/macros/*.t'
make check TEST='tests/directives/200-*.t'
make check TEST='tests/directives/400-*.t tests/directives/800-*.t'
make test
make run INPUT='tests/directives/400-multiple-source-files.t*'
```

`make check` runs selected cases and compares their outputs. `make test` runs
both groups. The wrappers arrange the working directory needed for relative
includes. For a case named `name.t`, any numbered companions such as `name.t2`
are additional primary source files for that invocation, in lexical order.
References compare the output file and exit status, with the existing
normalization for date, time, and author macros. Diagnostic text is not graded.

Use `../dev/preproc-ref` to investigate a test and the root testing guide for
reference policy. You may run the tool directly with temporary files while
developing; no separate stdin implementation or macro-only executable is
required. Finish with the cumulative through-PA4 report from the root.

## What carries forward

Keep token kind, source spelling, decoded literal data, and source location
available to the parser. Keep preprocessing state local to a translation unit
and expose a reusable preprocessing entry point. The next lesson builds a
structured AST over that token stream; preprocessing remains a completed
stage and its tests remain in the cumulative report.

The detailed macro and directive explanations retain material from the
CPPGM Foundation's 2013 handouts.
