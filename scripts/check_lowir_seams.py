"""Check the LowIR comparison seams on one assignment lane.

usage: check_lowir_seams.py <assignment-dir> <lane> [--modes A,B] [--results FILE]

For every rewrite mode of lowir_seam_rewrite.py: copy the lane, apply the
rewrite to each `.my` output, compare the copies with their references
through the assignment's own harness (KEEP_GOING=1 scripts/compare_results.pl
ref my), and hold the lane to one invariant:

  - a presentation or normalization rewrite passes every fixture;
  - a convention rewrite fails at least one fixture it changed;
  - the sentence each mode points at is still in pa13/lowir.md.

So everything the comparison rejects is a written convention, and
everything it absorbs is a written normalization.  A new rejection with no
sentence behind it fails the lane.  Exit status 0 when the invariant holds
for every mode; the table it prints is also the record `--results` writes.
