# The gold-standard self/host measurement: time the two producer stages of
# inception on identical inputs with identical parallelism.  The selfhost
# stage compiles the compiler with the host-built dev/cppgm++; the inception
# stage compiles it again with the self-built compiler.  The wall ratio of
# the second over the first is the number PLAN-LIBCXX-PERFORMANCE.md calls
# the gold standard, and it is only a fair ratio when both stages get the
# same job count, which pa39 does not do by default (the inception stage is
# capped at 8).

#
# The three pa39 roots of the cell are moved aside first (never deleted), so
# the run starts from nothing, and dev/cppgm++ is rebuilt for the cell since
# it is one path shared by all cells.
