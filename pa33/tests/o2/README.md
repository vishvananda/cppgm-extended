# Machine optimization at O2

Each `.t` file is LowIR input for `lowir2native -O2`. Course checks use
program outcomes and the code-quality envelopes in `.ref.expect`; informational
MIR dumps are not exact-output oracles. See the [PA33 handout](../../README.md)
for the contract and `tests/regression/` for solution-specific output checks.
