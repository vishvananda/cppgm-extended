# LLVM gap strategy: 10 November 2026

The working target is cppgm-built LLVM compiling the 325 frozen cppgm units
in at most 1.05 times native-built LLVM's elapsed time, at every level.
The qualified O1 level moves now measure 12.99% overhead over five ABBA
blocks (95% interval 9.68%-16.31%). The target remains unmet. The preceding
measurements were 16.96%, 18.25% and 19.19% at O1, O2 and O3; O2 and O3 have
not been remeasured after this checkpoint. Those older runs and the current
one are not a paired proof of the improvement between compiler revisions.

## Method adopted from `~/gap.md`

First measure sibling calls, existing aggregate splitting and select formation
at O1, independently. Then prioritize aggregate representation, executed code
footprint, inlining, branch shape and address folding. Screen immutable private compilers by
rebuilding the profile-selected LLVM objects, verifying their outputs, then
running a deterministic ledger. The panel comprises number_literal, store_motion,
program_lowering and class_templates; its six metrics are executed distinct code
bytes, modelled L2 code misses, bytes per instruction, instructions, conditional
branches and call instructions. Add Instructions.cpp to the original 34-provider
slice: it contains CmpPredicate::getMatching; Instruction.cpp alone does not.

Retain the hardware event panel for store-forwarding blocks, resteers,
mispredictions, instruction TLB events, code-cache misses, micro-operations and
fetch stalls. Check both hardware siblings for load. Keep raw observations and
flag cycle outliers; instruction reductions alone are not acceptance evidence.
Fewer events per group avoid multiplexing on this host. Historical whole-workload
records omit several of these events, so they cannot fit all proposed mechanism
costs; assumed event costs are not calibrated or causal attribution.

Require a mechanism bound before changing policy. Measure compile instructions
on semantic_overload.cpp at O0, O1, O2 and O3. The original baseline is the
immutable 558f42c8 compiler adopted in 54bdf818b. The user subsequently clarified
that moving existing work between optimization levels establishes a new
baseline: remeasure after the three O1 moves, then charge future structural
work against that compiler. Retain the old comparison as the cost of changing
level contents, rather than counting it as new aggregate work.
A batch up to 0.5% uses the normal gate;
cumulative growth up to 2% requires the predicted panel movement. Above 2%,
cumulative growth must be covered point for point by proven runtime gain at
that same level: the lower 95% bound on the whole-workload cycle-ratio drop,
over at least five ABBA pairs. Above 10% also needs user sign-off. All outputs
must match the native oracle in every observation, with the predicted event
movement; a cycle-only change requires checks with three link orders. O0,
RSS and PA36 release limits remain unchanged. Report per-level baseline,
current cost, growth, proven gain and headroom together.

Before using more than 0.5%, require a cheap no-candidate exit, shared analyses,
no per-candidate body rescans, an on/off cost measurement and removal of
superseded special cases. Qualify commits with the usual tests and audits. Rebuild full
LLVM and make an elapsed comparison after a workstream, with at least five ABBA
pairs. The elapsed target stays 1.05, independently of the working counter ledger.

## Correctness prerequisite: constructor exports

The full LLVM rebuilt with 54bdf818b exposed 131 undefined weak constructor or
destructor entry names, although the focused matrix passed. The first executed
failure called APInt's complete-object move constructor through address zero.
A base-only COMDAT group could discard another group's additional alias exports.
Exporting reverse aliases fixed the all-cppgm build but failed with native Clang,
whose corresponding group can legitimately export only the base entry. That
private approach was rejected and is absent from the final change.

The object writer now gives a group with multiple exported aliases a signature
encoding its entire sorted export set. Equal bundles coalesce; a group exporting
fewer names cannot discard a required alias. Single-export groups retain their
ordinary keys. Synthetic ELF signatures are local, non-function symbols; Mach-O
keeps its existing behavior. No constructor-name parsing or extra course IR
exports are needed.

The PA33 hosted regression combines a base-only producer and a producer needing
both entries. It failed before at O1-O3 with the base-only object first. A separate
384-case matrix covers mixed optimization levels, GCC/Clang objects, BFD/LLD and
all six link orders. All pass after the final fix. Full LLVM rebuilds, and its
325 frozen object files and linked cppgm executable match native byte for byte.
There are no undefined weak constructor/destructor entries in that LLVM image.

Validation: strict report 10,587/10,587; debug checks; self-host through PA5;
inception; PA36 quick/smoke; harness; architecture, format, file and placement
audits. Frozen compile-instruction ratios versus 54bdf818b are 1.001161 at O0
and 1.000078 at O3; RSS stays within the gate. No runtime gain is claimed for
this correctness repair.

## Aggregate work in progress

Private prototypes widen overlapping integer slot accesses, enable O1 packing,
and replace eligible incoming eightbyte object homes with scalar carriers.
The original getMatching example loses its argument homes. Further prototypes
cover eightbyte call results and return construction. They pass standalone
controls, including escaping addresses, volatile storage, floating ABI classes,
stack arguments, mixed widths and inlined object returns. The wider LLVM slice
exposed additional integration defects. A private late word-return prototype
now builds full LLVM and reproduces all 325 native objects and the linked
executable. Its getMatching fast path keeps the 12-byte payload in registers,
but its fallback still saves registers on the stack. The 35-object screen
reduces blocked store forwarding by 2.3% while increasing instructions by 1%;
fetch stalls and code-cache misses are flat. The full replay also increases
instructions, so this prototype is not adopted. Its temporary return
representation is native-only and lacks serialized IR support. No aggregate
exit criterion from gap.md is yet met.

## O1 level contents

PA33 leaves level contents to the implementation; PA34 specifies behavior and
quality bounds. Both handouts have been read. No handout change is necessary.
Sibling calls retain the frame, stack-argument, exception-model and addressed
block guards. Ordinary aggregate splitting already runs at O1; the experiment
moves its remaining packing, scalar-address and indexed-region guards, plus
the addressed-block invocation. Select formation is tested independently of
the rest of the O2 late pipeline. Existing tests that forbid O1 tail jumps
need their level expectation changed while retaining the correctness guards.

Each feature has a separate immutable compiler and 35-object LLVM relink.
The separate O1 compile-instruction costs versus the preceding compiler are
0.013% for sibling calls, 1.112% for the aggregate guards and 1.957% for select
formation. Combined, the level moves cost 3.127% at O1. The O0, O2 and O3
pipelines are unchanged; their frozen objects match the preceding compiler.

The qualified baseline after moving the existing passes is below. Future
growth and proven gains are measured from
this baseline, per the user's clarification. Headroom is the unproven 2-point
allowance; O0 retains its existing, separate limit.

| Level | Baseline instructions | Current instructions | Growth | Proven gain | Headroom |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| O0 | 3.276616 G | 3.276616 G | 0% | 0 points | Existing O0 gate |
| O1 | 7.674418 G | 7.674418 G | 0% | 0 points | 2 points |
| O2 | 9.070676 G | 9.070676 G | 0% | 0 points | 2 points |
| O3 | 9.421919 G | 9.421919 G | 0% | 0 points | 2 points |

On the number_literal relink screen, sibling calls reduce actual calls by
4.35%; select formation increases conditional moves/setcc by 30.7% and reduces
conditional branches by 1.46%. These are partial-rebuild mechanism results,
not runtime gains. The complete LLVM built with all three moves produces all
325 cppgm objects and the linked executable byte-identically to native LLVM.
The five-block whole-workload comparison reports the following ratios to native:

| Metric | Mean ratio | 95% interval |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Elapsed | 1.1299 | 1.0968-1.1631 |
| Cycles | 1.1417 | 1.1196-1.1637 |
| Instructions | 1.06591 | 1.06589-1.06593 |
| L1 code misses | 1.1654 | 1.1368-1.1939 |
| Fetch stalls | 1.3029 | 1.2735-1.3323 |

The run uses fresh native A/A calibration and five alternating ABBA blocks,
12 fixed physical cores, unchanged binaries and frozen inputs. All 325 object
hashes and the linked executable match the native oracle on all 22 observations.
Raw sibling load records show shared-host activity during the run; every
observation is retained and the interval reflects block variation. This is a
new baseline score, not proof of a same-level gain funding future compile cost.

Qualification passes: strict report 10,589/10,589 including the updated
survivor controls; debug checks; self-host through PA5; inception; PA36
quick/smoke; harness; architecture, format, file and global placement audits.
The complete harness passes on retry after one timeout-cleanup fixture failed
when the runner was restricted to one CPU. Its separate retry also passes;
no timeout harness code was changed. The placement audit finds no fixture moves.
On store_motion, the complete LLVM's count panel reports blocked store
forwarding down 7.65%, mispredictions down 4.49% and fetch stalls down 2.66%
against the previous build. All outputs match; cycle outliers remain recorded.
