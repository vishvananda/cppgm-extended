# Project Layout

`cppgm` is organized as one cumulative compiler implementation plus PA-specific
assignment harnesses.

## Repository Layout

- `Makefile`: root build, test, report, reference, and inception targets
- `dev/`: compiler entry points
- `dev/src/`: shared compiler implementation files and support headers
- `dev/frontend_source_sets.mk`: per-tool lists of `dev/src/*.cpp` files to
  link into each compiler binary
- `paN/`: assignment handouts, Makefiles, tests, scripts, and reference
  fixtures for the active milestones
- `student.tests/`: personal tests and harnesses, run explicitly
- `doc/`: public reference material, including `doc/n3485.txt`
- `obj/`: generated build artifacts
- `reference-binaries/`: reference-binary manifest; the large binary payloads
  download automatically when `*-ref` wrappers need them

Most `paN/` directories are thin wrappers around the shared implementation.
They define the milestone contract and test surface; production compiler code
should stay in `dev/` and `dev/src/`.

When you add a new implementation source file under `dev/src/`, also add its
basename to each tool that needs it in `dev/frontend_source_sets.mk`. Use the
path without `.cpp`; for example, `dev/src/syntax/foo.cpp` is listed as
`syntax/foo`.

## Assignment Arc

- PA1-PA4: tokens, literals, preprocessing expressions, and full preprocessing
- PA5-PA7: AST, types, lookup, conversions, calls, and overload resolution
- PA8: LowIR model, reader/writer, and required construction exercises
- PA9: typed Itanium ABI naming
- PA10-PA13: procedural lowering, classes, value semantics, and virtual dispatch
- PA14-PA19: templates, constant evaluation, and template integration
- PA20-PA23: remaining source-to-LowIR language and object-model closure
- PA24: native backend from LowIR
- PA25-PA26: compile/link driver integration and host exception metadata
- PA27-PA31: host ABI and hosted compatibility
- PA32-PA33: LowIR and machine-backend optimization
- PA34: inception, rebuilding `cppgm++` with `cppgm++`

## PA34

PA34 rebuilds your compiler with itself. The host-built `dev/cppgm++` produces
`cppgm++-self`, which produces `cppgm++-inception`. Completion requires the
last two binaries to match byte for byte. The `test-through-paN` ladder runs
earlier assignment tests with self-built tools while you work toward that
comparison; see [PA34](pa34/README.md) for the commands.
