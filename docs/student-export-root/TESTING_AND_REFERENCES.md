# Testing and references

Run these commands from the repository root, replacing N with the assignment
number:

```sh
make build
make test-paN
make test-report-through-paN
make test-report
make inception
```

For PA1–PA33, a clean through-milestone report is the exit criterion. PA34 ends
with inception. `make test` builds once and runs all assignment suites;
`make test-report` keeps going and summarizes failures. Use
`ACTIVE_TEST_REPORT_PAS='pa8 pa10'` to narrow a report.

## Local checks and toolchains

```sh
make -C pa8 check TEST='tests/spec/100-*.t'
make -C pa8 check TEST='tests/behavior/100-sum.t tests/behavior/200-swap.t'
make CXX=g++ CPPGM_HOST_CXX=g++
```

`TEST=` accepts a path, quoted glob or quoted list; mixed-input assignments
route each fixture to its runner. Finish with the root through target.
Keep a real host compiler in `CPPGM_HOST_CXX` when PA34 uses
`CXX=../dev/cppgm++`. Use a separate object root for different toolchains.

## Test locations and requirements

- Required fixtures live in `paN/tests/`, in the buckets named by the handout.
  `controls/` holds focused property checks with no complete-output oracle.
- Personal inputs and harnesses live in `student.tests/`; run them explicitly.
  Default assignment targets do not discover that directory.
- PA24 and PA32 also ship `tests/regression/`, which pins the course
  solution's particular design. Those fixtures are outside your exit criteria;
  default `make test` and the through reports run the course contract.

PA33 checks executable behavior, declared MIR bounds and debug locations.
It requires no profiler, allocator statistics or exact optimized MIR match.

From PA5 onward, filenames use a three-digit feature-cluster prefix
(`100-`, `200-`, ...); PA1–PA4 use finer subgroups. Controls and solution
regressions follow their own local naming. Required rejection cases are in the
owning suite; unspecified inputs do not add requirements.

## References

Use the oracle named by the handout: output, exit status, a focused property,
or a code-quality envelope. Diagnostic text is not compared. Informational
LowIR/MIR sidecars do not become grading requirements merely because they ship.

PA8 requires a LowIR model, reader/validator, writer and three construction
exercises. The harness uses `lowir-ref` for roundtrips and `lowir2native-ref`
to execute the student's constructed LowIR. Behavior checks accept alternative
valid LowIR and grade program outcomes. The student compiler must implement
LowIR construction and later C++ lowering itself.

PA12’s behavioral controls also execute your source-generated LowIR through
the supplied native backend. Your own native backend is introduced in PA24.

Reference wrappers download and verify a pinned bundle built from the current
cppgm-extended solution. They provide examples of the required behavior and
are not the original CPPGM binaries. Fetch them ahead of time with:

```sh
make reference-binaries
```

Reference wrappers fail if a tool cannot be downloaded or verified; they
never fall back to your implementation.

Failed-case stdout is an informational example. Successful stdout and
required exit-status sidecars remain
oracles. [The LowIR specification](pa8/lowir.md) explains normal comparison's
presentation tolerance.

Reference implementations and checked outputs are not guaranteed bug-free.
Preserve them by default. You may correct reference outputs when a reduced
reproducer and cited C++11 rules—or the LowIR contract for IR-only cases—prove
them incorrect. Document the proof and bundle revision. Compiler agreement
alone is insufficient. Never weaken required behavior, coverage, or comparison
rules.

## Debug and inspection checks

Run the debug, object and link checks required by the current handout.
`make test-debuginfo` collects the later debug suites; it is not an extra
prerequisite for early assignments.
